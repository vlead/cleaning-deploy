#+Title:  Ensure availability of labs running from IIIT infrastructure
#+Author: VLEAD
#+Date:   [2015-04-10 Fri]

* Problem
  At present, the hosting platfrom of labs is not from a single location.  Also,
  some of the labs are hosted from multiple places.  VLEAD has the task of
  hosting all the labs to a single platfrom - AWS cloud.  Before VLEAD moves all
  the labs to cloud, the labs should be available to the general public.
  
  http://vlab.co.in is the landing page that is used by outreach.  This page
  has links to the labs that are hosted from multiple places.  Some of the
  links from this page point to labs hosted on IIIT infrastructure.
  
  A majority of the labs hosted on IIIT infrastructure are running from a
  single container though some labs are deployed on individual containers.  If
  there is problem - memory leak, process spawning etc., - with a single lab on
  the deploy container, other labs also get affected and availability is
  compromised.

* Objective
  The purpose of this exercise is to:

  1. Create a clear picture of IIIT infrastructure vis a vis hosting of labs.

  2. Ensure there is always only one version of lab running in production,
     which is reachable from vlab.co.in.

  3. Ensure each lab runs from one container.

  4. Decommission deploy container on base2 which is currently running multiple
     labs. 

  5. Make http://vlab.co.in the unique and official landing page of virtual
     labs.  Decomission http://virtual-labs.ac.in or make it point to
     http://vlab.co.in.

** Definitions
  + deploy  :: the container running labs and other stuff
 
  + iiit infrastructure :: deploy plus other machines/containers.  

  + set A       ::  Things running on the IIIT infrastructure.

  + set B       ::  Labs listed on vlab.co.in.

  + Partition 1 :: Labs deployed on IIIT infrastructure and pointed to by
                   vlab.co.in and =NOT= at L5.

  + Partition 2 :: Labs deployed on IIIT infrastructure and pointed to by
                   vlab.co.in and at L5.

  + Partition 5 :: Labs deployed on IIIT infrastructure and =NOT= pointed to by
                   vlab.co.in and =NOT= at L5.

  + Partition 6 :: Labs deployed on IIIT infrastructure and =NOT= pointed to by
                   vlab.co.in and at L5.

  + Partition 4 :: Neither pointed to by vlab.co.in nor by
                   virtual-labs.ac.in.  Note that whether this labs
                   are working or not is not a factor to consider
                   while treating them as part of partition 4.

  + Partition 3 :: Labs pointed by vlab.co.in and =NOT= deployed on IIIT
                   infrastructure but at L5.

  + Partition 7 :: Labs pointed by vlab.co.in and =NOT= deployed on IIIT
                   infrastructure and =NOT= at L5.

** Enumerating all the labs on IIIT infrastructure into partitions 
*** Partition 1: Labs deployed on IIIT infrastructure and pointed to by vlab.co.in and =NOT= at L5

    This table defines partition 1 and total labs are 26.

*** Partition 3: Labs pointed by vlab.co.in and =NOT= hosted at deploy but at L5
    This table defines partition 3
*** Partition 7: Labs pointed by vlab.co.in and =NOT= hosted on deploy and =NOT= at L5
    This table defines partition 7

* Plan
** Labs in Partition 2
   For labs in partition 2 do the following:
   1. After AWS platform is ready, deploy the labs in partition 2 on
      AWS. This will be done as part of May 1st deadline.
   2. Edit the link for each lab on vlab.co.in and point it to this
      new public url.
** Labs in Partition 1
   For labs in partition 1 do the following:
   1. Deploy all the labs in partition 1 in seperate contianers.
   2. Make each lab accessible by a public url.
   3. Edit the link for each lab on vlab.co.in and point it to this
      new public url.
   4. For broken labs, set up a meeting to chalk out different strategies.
** Labs in Partition 5
  1. For the labs with broken links on vlab.co.in, deploy them on independent
     containers.
  2. Make each lab accessible by a public url.
  3. Edit the link for each lab on vlab.co.in and point it to this new public
     url.
** Labs in Partition 6
  1. The 'request for hosting' has been made for them, and they will be hosted
     as part May 1st deadline.
* Meeting minutes
** Meeting on [2015-04-08 Wed]
*** Introduction
   Professor along with Geeta, Apurv, Sravanthi participated in
   outreach the whole day. They came back with feedback and wanted to
   discuss on availability of the labs on deploy container. This
   meeting was held on [2015-04-08 Wed]

*** Attendees
   Apurv, Saurabh, Geeta(half time), Soumya(quarter time)Thirumal,
   Venkatesh, Zubair

*** Duration
   18.05 to 20.08

*** Observations 
 - Professor wanted to know the issue with deploy container and how to
   fix it.
 - Saurabh explained the cause of the issue and when was it discovered
   and documented, possible solutions.
 - Professor suggested find the labs which might be causing this
   issue.
 - Saurabh presented the current task list for the deadlines in April,
   May and how adding new tasks will affect other tasks.

* Implementation 
  After a rigorous discussion: Soumya,Shiva,Sanchita and Zubair
  planned for the process to be carried out as described below.
  (10:50 a.m.-11:50 a.m.)

** Possible options
   This section describes the different options that we have in
   implementing the deploy clean up.
*** Naming convention of URL for Lab
    - <lab id>-<institute name>.virtual-labs.ac.in
    - <short form of lab name>.virtual-labs.ac.in
    - deploy.virtual-labs.ac.in/<lab-id>
*** Base machines
    - Base 2
    - Base 3
** Decisions
*** Naming convention of URL for Lab
    To decide which naming convention would suite the best we need to
    consider several factors.
    - Reverse Proxy entries(Virtual hosts)
    - Awstats (the configuration file)
    - Logs (location, for each lab)
    All the above factors are interdependent. The main focus is on
    Awstats. 
      + The analytics should not be lost during the clean up
        process. The awstats requires the correct log files to display
        the statistics. If the log file is changed all the current
        statistics till date will not be displayed on the awstats
        GUI.
      + Also the log file location and name specified in the virtual
        host entry on the Reverse proxy must be the same in the
        "awstats.<lab-id>.conf" file.
    Having two different virtual hosts to point to a single log file
    is possible.  Hence, to make things simpler, it was decided that
    the "<lab-id>-<institute-name>.virtual-labs.ac.in" naming
    convention would be followed. Each lab will have a separate Virtual-host
    entry. Only the access-log name and location, will follow the same
    convention as that in the "awstats.<lab-id>.conf" file. This
    allows the new statistics to be displayed, without the old ones
    being lost.
*** Base Machines
    There is more space in the Base3 as compared to Base2 machine
    hence it was decided that the containers will be created on Base3.
** Procedure
   + Total of 31 labs have been identified which have to be deployed in separate
     containers. Out of 31, 26 labs are in partition 1 and rest in partition 5 which
     are been focussed on.
   + All the labs are to be deployed in Base3 machine, each in separate container.
   + After creating the containers in Base3, reverseproxy entries would be added.
   + Following the above step, private DNS entries and public DNS entries would be added.
   + Checking all the labs whether they are working by opening their URLs in browser.
   + Enabling the Awstats which would provide the current satistics of the running labs.
   + Informing Amritha University (as labs would now be pointing to vlabs.co.in ) coordinators regarding the 
     inclusion of these links.
   + Updating VLEAD Wiki with the detailed process of the deployment in Base3 for all the above mentioned labs.
   
** Impediments and Issues
*** Partition 1
    There are 3 labs which have broken links. When the problem leading
    to the unavailability of these labs was looked into, the following
    observations were made:
    - The sources of Virtual Satellite Image processing Lab (civil11)
      from IIT Bombay are not present on the deploy container. There
      is a separate Reverse Proxy entry ( a virtual host ) but the
      link mentioned doesnt work. Because there is a separate reverse
      proxy entry there should be a DNS entry too, which is
      missing. On further investigation it was found that this lab was
      a windows VM running on base1 machine.
       - Update :: civil11_backup present on base2 is the actual
                   production windows VM.  The name _backup is
                   confusing but this is the real production VM.
    - The Reverse proxy entry of the Software engineering lab (cse08)
      points to a URL which is not hosted by IIIT infrastructure. That
      link works. There is a separate container on Base2 to which the
      private DNS entry points (10.4.12.180, ctid-12180). When the IP
      of this container is used to open the lab on the browser, it
      shows the default "It works" page. The lab sources on this
      container are not placed in the proper location. The sources are
      not present on deploy container either.
       - Update :: Consider this lab to be in partition 4 (not pointed
                   by virtual-labs.ac.in and not pointed by
                   vlab.co.in) unless vlab.co.in points to us and then
                   we redirect somewhere else.  In that case give the
                   URL where reverseproxy requests are sent to
                   vlab.co.in so that requests from college users
                   directly go to place where labs are hosted.  At the
                   end the lab can be deleted considering it never
                   existed, same as all other labs of partition 4.
    - There Reverse Proxy entry for the Advanced Network Technologies
      lab (cse28) points to a URL which is not hosted by the IIIT
      infrasctructure. That link works. There is DNS entry for this
      lab which points to the same cotainer as above (10.4.12.180,
      ctid-12180). The sources are not available on deploy container.
      - Update :: Same as above.  Treat as part of partition 4.  Get
                  links changed on vlab.co.in as necessary.
    - Labs (which are deployed on separate containers on base3 so far
      ) are redirecting to deploy container for simulations. This was
      noticed when the labs were being checked if they worked fine
      after the deployment process. The labs having these issues are:
      + cse30-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in (issue resolved)
      + cse17-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in (issue resolved)
      + cse21-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in (issue resolved)
      - Update :: Sources from which these labs were cloned into thier
                  respective containers:
                  - cse30 :: https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/analog-cmos-vlsi-circuit-design-iiith
                  - cse21 :: https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/optical-remote-sensing-iiith
                  - cse17 :: https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/mobile-robotics-iiith

*** IIT Bombay, civil 13 lab status 

    A container was created for this lab (CTID 12069) and the basic
    dependencies were installed (php, Apache). The sources were copied
    form deploy container into this container. The lab has "mysql"
    dependency for which the steps for deployment were not
    available. Hence, this lab was not deployed the way it should.  A
    mail was sent to Pushpdeep asking the process for redeploying of
    this lab. In his reply he clearly mentioned to keep the
    redeployment process on hold because the lab needed to be verified
    by experts.  So, the public url of the container was not sent to
    vlab.co.in and deploy was decommissioned leaving the lab
    temporarily unavailable. The lab can however, be accessed from the
    container public URL (civil13-iitb.virtual-labs.ac.in) but may not
    work according to the developer's design.
    
    A request was sent by Pushpdeep to send the sources of the lab
    that VLEAD had so that he can bring the lab to L6. The sources
    were sent.

** Status
- [2015-05-05 Tue] :

- A total of *24* labs from deploy container were deployed on separate
  containers and their public urls were updated on vlab.co.in
- A total of *25* labs were deployed on AWS and their public urls
  updated on vlab.co.in.
- virtual-labs.ac.in redirected to vlab.co.in
- deploy container stopped.

* Work Plan
** DONE Take decisions (see here [[Decisions]]) on how to name labs and which base machine to deploy them [2015-04-14 Tue]
** DONE Team discussion to plan a [[Procedure]] [2015-04-14 Tue]
** DONE Decide the IP range [2015-04-14 Tue]
** DONE Creation of 23 containers (from Partition 1) on base3 [2015-04-14 Tue]
** DONE copy the lab sources from Deploy to the corresponding container [2015-04-14 Tue]
** DONE Add entries in Reverse Proxy [2015-04-14 Tue]
** DONE Add Private and Public DNS entries [2015-04-15 Wed]
** DONE Add awstats entries [2015-04-15 Wed]
** DONE Complete configuration of Awstats [2015-04-15 Wed]
** DONE complete the entries in the wiki [2015-04-15 Wed]
** DONE Examine the issues with the non working labs in Partition 1 [2015-04-15 Wed]
** DONE Examine the issues for the broken links in Partition 5 [2015-04-15 Wed]
** DONE Complete the documentation [2015-04-15 Wed]
** DONE 3 Lab experiments still redirect to the deploy container. 2 have been resolved. 1 still remains.
        - This has been resolved. Now all the three labs work and do
          not point to deploy container.
** TODO Configure Rsnapshot for all the newly created containers [2015-04-15 Wed]
        - Requires input on which ones the backup should be taken for.
** DONE Inform vlab.co.in to point to these labs
** DONE Get access to vlab.co.in [Geeta is looking into it] [[https://bitbucket.org/vlead/systems/issue/18][issue 18 bitbucket]]
** TODO Redirect the virtual-labs.ac.in to vlab.co.in 
        When a user requests virtual-labs.ac.in he should be
        redirected to vlab.co.in. 
        - All labs on IIIT infrastructure need to be pointed by
          vlab.co.in. 
        - All the links have to be checked. check if they point to
          deploy. If they are we need to take action and point them to
          the proper place. (done)
        - The list of [[labs to be sent to vlab.co.in]] should be
          prepared.
